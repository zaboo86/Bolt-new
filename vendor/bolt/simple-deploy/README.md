Bolt Simple Deploy Tool
=======================

To use this tool, on your development machine **only** you can create a file
named `.deploy.yml`.

Each key in the `.deploy.yml` represents a deployment target that can be
uploaded to via either FTP or SFTP (secure FTP).

Every deployment configuration you add to `.deploy.yml` must set the `protocol`
to either `ftp` or `sftp`, and an `options` array.

**NOTE:** If your host provides SFTP, it is the preferred upload method as it
is both faster and more secure than FTP alone, and supports more functionality.

Configuration File
------------------

Configuration is done in a `.deploy.yml` file in the site's root directory on
your development environment, with the following format:

```
staging:
    protocol:
    options:
        host:
        root:
        username:
        â€¦

| ------------ | ----------- |
| host         | DNS host name to upload to
| root         | The root directory of the remote site. Can be an absolute path, or if missing a trailing `/` it will be assumed to be a subdirectory of the remote user's home directory
| username     | User name to login to the remote host with
| password     | Password to login to the remote host with
| port         | (optional) Port number to connect to if the target is not listening on the default
| ssl          | (optional) Connect to the FTP target host over a secure SSL-FTP connection

        host: example.com
        root: my-site
        username: deploy
        password: 'your password goes here'
```

**NOTE:** In the above example, the root directory is a subdirectory of the
remote user's home directory called `my-site/`, e.g. `/home/deploy/my-site/`.


### SFTP Options

```

    protocol: sftp
    options:
        host: example.com
        username: deploy
        password: 'your password goes here'
        root: /var/www/sites/example.com
```


#### Example: Key-Based Login

```
production:
    protocol: sftp
    options:
        host: example.com
        username: deploy
        privateKey: /home/your_home_dir/.ssh/id_rsa
        root: /var/www/sites/example.com
```


### Setting Permissions

You can control the permissions of **newly created** files and directories by
adding a `permissions` key under `options`.

By default, Simple Deploy will set files to `0664` and directories to `0775`,
but if you need less restricted permissions (not recommended) you can set
them like:

```
    options:
        permissions:
            file: 0666
            dir: 0777
```

Of course more secure values are also possible and recommended.


### Editing

A very simple editor is also available by adding the `--edit` option to the
command.

```
php app/nut setup:deploy --edit <target>
```


#### Example: Editing the configuration for the "production" target

```
php app/nut setup:deploy --edit production
```
