Bolt Google Maps
================================

**This is the readme for v2, if you are using v1 you want to look at
[the v1 readme](readme.v1.md)**

This extension creates a twig function that takes a number of values
and creates a google map via the v3 Google Maps API.
You can pass in simple values, a single geolocation object, an array
of geolocation objects, a record or multiple records.

Example with Mapstyles, Geolocation and using optional parameters to
output the distance and the time to get to a marker:

![Bolt google maps image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SahAssar/bolt-google-maps/master/gmaps.png)

The icon fields are compatible with `Raistlfiren/FAIconFieldType` and
the color fields are compatible with `sahassar/bootstrapcolorpicker`.

**The map has no set height by default. This is because it is often
used in situations where no height should be set (like in a flex
grid). In your css just enter `.map-canvas{height:50vh}` or 
whatever height you want.**

I recommend that you install those if non-techies will update those 
fields.

####Named values

A simple map is usually constructed with named values passed to the map()
function, like this:

    {{map(
        latitude = record.geolocation.latitude,
        longitude = record.geolocation.longitude,
        html = record.body,
        icon = "fa-map-marker"
    )}}

####Single map field

You can also supply it with the bolt geolocation object directly like this:

    {{map( map = record.map )}}

You can set the HTML for the infopopup via the `html` argument. The default 
is the `formatted_address` of the geolocation field. You can also set the map
icon with the `icon` argument:

    {{map(
        map = record.map,
        html = record.body,
        icon = "fa-map-marker"
    )}}

####Multiple map fields

Multiple geolocation objects also work, which is useful for when you build a
map from multiple contenttypes:

    {% set maps = [] %}
    {% for record in records %}
        {% set maps = maps|merge([record.geolocation]) %}
    {% endfor %}
    {{map( maps = maps )}}

####Single record

You can also pass a single record, which will assume that your geolocation field
is called `geolocation`, your html field is called `body`, your icon field is
called `icon` and your color field is called `color`.

    {{map( record = record )}}
    
You can change where it looks for these values by following this example:

    {{map(
        record = record,
        geolocation-field = "geolocation",
        html_field = "body",
        icon_field = "icon",
        color_field = "color"
    )}}
    
The values passed are the names of the fields you want to use for the respective property.

####Multiple records

Just like passing a record you can also pass multiple records to the function. Just like
in the previous example you can change which fields it looks for by passing additional
arguments.

    {{map( records = records )}}

And overwriting what values to use also works just like a single record:

    {{map(
        records = records,
        geolocation_field = "geolocation",
        html_field = "body",
        icon_field = "icon",
        color_field = "color"
    )}}
    
####Geolocation

If you set `geolocation = true` it will try to get the visitors position and plot a route
from them to the closest marker. The map is rendered first without geolocation, and then
with the directions after the visitor has accepted to share his or her location.

    {{map(
        record = record,
        geolocation = true
    )}}

If you supply it with duration_holder and distance_holder it will output the trip duration
and it's distance to them after the route is plotted. You can use this to display route
information to the visitor. duration_holder and distance_holder take any valid selector.

    <p>
    You have <span id="distance_holder"></span> to walk,
    if you leave now you can be there in <span id="duration_holder"></span>!
    </p>

    {{map(
        record = record,
        geolocation = true,
        duration_holder = "#duration_holder",
        distance_holder = "#distance_holder",
        travel_mode = "walking"
    )}}
    
    
####Additional options

By default the map will not allow for zooming, scrolling or panning. You can change this by
passing an options array, which will set the the mapoptions. See here for a reference:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?hl=en#MapOptions

    {{map(
        record = record,
        google_options = {
            scrollwheel: true,
            navigationControl: true,
            mapTypeControl: true,
            scaleControl: true,
            draggable: true,
            disableDefaultUI: false
        }
    )}}
    
####JS

The JS has a couple of calls that you can implement to modify the data or appearace of the
map. This an example of the JS options:

    window.mapjs = {
        //Zoom level when there is only one marker
        defaultzoom: 16, 
        //Mapstyles to be applied to the map. See http://www.mapstylr.com/ or https://snazzymaps.com/ for examples.
        mapstyles: "", 
        //Called before initizialization of the JS
        beforeInit: function(){}, 
        //Called before rendering of each map. Passed the element, which contains all data for the map and is the DOM element it will be drawn to.
        beforeRender: function(element){}, 
        //Called after rendering of each map. Also passed the element.
        afterRender: function(element){}, 
        //Called before geolocation is attempted for each map. Also passed the element.
        beforeGeoloc: function(element){}, 
        //Called after geolocation is done for each map. Also passed the element.
        afterGeoloc: function(element){}, 
        //Called before directions are attempted for each map. Also passed the element.
        beforeDirections: function(element){}, 
        //Called after directions are rendered and done for each map. Also passed the element.
        afterDirections: function(element){} 
    }

Almost every value and object used is a property of the element object which is supplied by
these methods or can be fetched by querying the dom for your map. You can change these as 
you want before rendering or in the methods.


####A couple of notes

 - If you put the `disable_script_injecting: true` in the global config the extension will not
   load it's usual scripts and styles. This is useful for when you want to include them in your
   own scripts and styles, load them via a cdn or modify them.
 - The scripts have no external dependencies except the Google Maps API.
 - You can use leaflet instead of Google Maps by setting `disable_script_injecting: true`, including leaflet and putting the below script in your JS:
 
 ```
 Array.prototype.forEach.call(document.getElementsByClassName("map-canvas"), function (elem) {
    var places = JSON.parse(elem.dataset.mapobj);
    var center = L.latLngBounds([places[0].latitude, places[0].longitude], [places[1].latitude, places[1].longitude]);
    places.forEach(function(place){
        center.extend([ place.latitude, place.longitude ]);
    })
    var map = L.map(elem, {
        scrollWheelZoom: false,
        center: center.getCenter(),
        layers: [L.tileLayer('/tileserver{s}/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
            attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors, &copy; <a href="http://cartodb.com/attributions">CartoDB</a>'
        })],
        zoom: 11
    }).fitBounds(center);
    places.forEach(function(place){
        var cssIcon = L.divIcon({
            className: typeof place.icon == "string" ? 'fa ' + place.icon : 'fa fa-taxi',
            iconSize: typeof place.iconSize == "array" ? place.icon : [20, 37]
        });
        L.Icon.Default.imagePath = '/cssmodules/images';
        L.marker(
            [ place.latitude, place.longitude ],
            { icon: cssIcon }
        ).bindPopup(
            L.popup()
            .setContent(place.html)
        ).addTo(map);
    })
    map.fitBounds(center);
});
 ```
 
This example assumes that you proxy the tiles on your server (a good idea if 
you are using http2), so you need to add the following to your nginx config (of 
course tweak these settings to fit your need, these are for cartodb maps):

```
